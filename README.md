# Objective  

This repository contains all the materials and code developed as part of the practical assignment for the **NoSQL Databases** course.  
The main goal is to provide students with hands-on experience in understanding and applying non-relational database paradigms, as well as in the design and implementation of systems.  

# Project Description  

Each group of students is responsible for the analysis, planning, and implementation of a project using:  
- one **relational database management system**, and  
- two **non-relational systems**: a document-oriented database (**MongoDB**) and a graph-oriented database (**Neo4j**).  

The starting point is a hospital management relational database, provided through the script `hospital.sql`, which includes tables, views, sequences, indexes, triggers, and procedures.  

# Project Tasks  

1. **Data Migration**: Define and explain the process of migrating data from the provided relational schema to the new non-relational systems, optimizing for the characteristics of each paradigm.  
2. **Query Implementation**: Develop and implement a set of queries that demonstrate the operability of the implemented systems.  
3. **Critical Analysis**: Carry out a critical evaluation of the work, comparing the models and functionalities of the non-relational systems with the original relational system.  

# Databases Used  

- **Relational**: Hospital Management System (via `hospital.sql`)  
- **Non-relational**:  
  - Document-oriented: **MongoDB**  
  - Graph-oriented: **Neo4j**  

# Repository Structure  

- `/relational`: Scripts and files related to the relational database system  
- `/mongodb`: Scripts and files for MongoDB  
- `/neo4j`: Scripts and files for Neo4j  
- `/docs`: Documentation and technical reports  

# Submission and Presentation  

The project must be submitted by **June 3, 2024**, in a compressed format (`TP_[GROUPX].zip`).  
It will be presented to the course instructors and must include demonstrations of the implemented databases and the queries created.
